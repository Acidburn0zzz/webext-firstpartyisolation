# Contributing to First Party Isolation

## Localization & Translations

These are the steps if you want to contribute messages for a new language:

- Figure out the short name for your language (e.g., `es`)
- Copy directory `en` into the directory with the short name (e.g., `es`)
- Modify the `message` fields in `messages.json`, but leave the descriptions intact
- Open a pull request with the new folder and modified `messages.json` file
- Done!
